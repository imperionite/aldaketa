This project focuses on simulating environmental sensor data for smart monitoring systems in the context of water quality monitoring as critical monitoring system for public health and environmental sustainability. Water supply networks are vulnerable to contamination, and timely detection of anomalies is essential for safe drinking water. Modern water systems use IoT sensors to collect high-frequency data (e.g., every minute) from various points in the distribution network.

The GECCO Industrial Challenges ([2018](https://www.spotseven.de/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/rulesGeccoIc2018.pdf) & [2019](https://www.th-koeln.de/mam/downloads/deutsch/hochschule/fakultaeten/informatik_und_ingenieurwissenschaften/rulesgeccoic2019.pdf)) provide real-world datasets and problem settings for developing and benchmarking algorithms for online anomaly/event/change detection in water quality time series. The datasets from GECCo 2018-2019 are harmonized, concatenated and processed to create a unified synthetic dataset for this project.

The project involves creating a synthetic dataset that mimics real sensor data measurements used in water plants, and prepares the data for future use in a blockchain-based system for secure, decentralized record-keeping.
