  "description": "This project focuses on simulating environmental sensor data for smart monitoring systems in the context of water quality monitoring as critical monitoring system for public health and environmental sustainability. Water supply networks are vulnerable to contamination, and timely detection of anomalies is essential for safe drinking water. Modern water systems use IoT sensors to collect high-frequency data (e.g., every minute) from various points in the distribution network.",
